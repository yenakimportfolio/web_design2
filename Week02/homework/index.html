    <p>Jordi Koalitic is a creative photography project born from the creative mind of the brothers Jordi and Arnau Puig, two content creators who have created their own style and way of understanding photography reaching millions of people around the world. Jordi currently has over 20million followers across all social platforms. Over a period of more than 5 years, and before his online medical explosion, Jordi worked as a Freelancer before creating his own audiovisual production company (Koalitic Visuals) with his brother Arnau. After the creation of their first Instagram account, the Puig brothers set up the foundations of their photography along with the feedback of the online trends.</p>
